# mpmb-sheet-scripts
All of these scripts are edited versions of existing scripts, the most I can say is that it imports into the sheet without any errors. This was slapped togther over the total span of a few hours (maybe a day), which means if I could get away with using the same text, I did. This was basically the first time I've touched code (especially this kind), so mistakes are something to be expected. I'll fix what I can (which means very little), just let me know.
